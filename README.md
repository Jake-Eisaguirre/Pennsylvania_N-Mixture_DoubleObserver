## Pennsylvania N-Mixture Models
The script found with in this repository contains N-Mixture models for determining population size and detection capabilities for the RIBBiTR Pennsylvania sites. There are two model structures deployed to account for the multiple observers per survey. The first method stacks observer visits into a single row and thus creating more visits per site in the N-Mixture table. The second method gives each site_observer combo a unique row with in the N-Mixture table.
